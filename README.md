# 🏥 Patient Care Classification Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify patients into different care categories based on their personal profiles and symptoms. Using synthetic healthcare data, the goal is to assist health institutions in providing tailored care, improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

## 🧠 Problem Definition

Our dataset categorizes patients into four classes reflecting the severity of their symptoms:

- **Preventive Care:** Lifestyle or professional advice to improve overall health  
- **Chronic Care:** Patients with ongoing chronic conditions requiring regular monitoring  
- **Urgent Care:** Patients showing alarming symptoms needing immediate attention  
- **Specialized Care:** Patients requiring referral to medical specialists  

This is a supervised classification problem, where we apply machine learning algorithms — specifically **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Random Forest** — to predict the appropriate care category for new patients.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas · NumPy · scikit-learn · matplotlib · seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Algorithms:** K-Nearest Neighbors · Random Forest  

## 📊 Data Source

- Synthetic healthcare dataset simulating patient profiles and symptoms.

## 📈 Key Features

- Data exploration and preprocessing of synthetic healthcare data  
- Application of classification algorithms to categorize patient care needs  
- Model performance evaluation and comparison between KNN and Random Forest  
- Insights for healthcare professionals to optimize patient care allocation

## 🧪 Project Reflections & Challenges

The project successfully:

- Identified key patterns in patient symptom data  
- Built models with high accuracy in classifying patient care categories  
- Differentiated patient needs into four distinct care groups  

Challenges included:

- Limited scope in chronic illness representation within the dataset  
- Synthetic data may not capture all real-world complexities  
- Future improvements require expanding symptom features and dataset size for better predictions

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Collect more comprehensive and real patient data  
- Expand features to include a broader range of symptoms and chronic diseases  
- Explore additional machine learning models and ensemble techniques  
- Develop a decision support system integrated with healthcare workflows
